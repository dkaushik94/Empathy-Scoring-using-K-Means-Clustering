## How to run the code. 

- Make sure you install the following packages as I have extensively used thee libraries to do the project:
    - scikit-learn
    - pygal
    - pandas
    - numpy
    - matplotlib
    - progress
    - seaborn

- Download the dataset from Kaggle and place it in the same directory as the clustering.py file. 
- Make sure the dataset file name is responses.csv as it is downloaded.
- Run the clustering.py file from the terminal and it will diplay high level verbosity.
- The prepdicted labels will be saved to a file names Predicted_labels.
